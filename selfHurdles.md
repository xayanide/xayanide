# Hurdles
Self evaluation for myself.

This assumes that I imagine myself without internet neither access to offline or online documentation of a language or library.

Simply invoking a sense of helplessness.

### HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
- What attributes can be used in a certain tag?
- What tags can be used and their uses?
- What tags are allowed and used inside a tag?
- Self enclosing tag <tag/>
- Semantics and order of tags
- Second least used language for me. If I barely have anything to do with a language, then I do not consider myself able to write well with it offline.

### JS: JavaScript (Favorite)
My programming hurdle in here is recalling objects' methods and properties that I do not use frequently, including what parameters a method accepts and what parameters and values it returns. Without fine familiarzation, documentation or internet lookup, they're hard. 
Everything else of the basic fundamentals are fine as long as I keep using them when writing offline.

### CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
- Least used.
- Everything (Currently. Because I barely use CSS at all)
- I can read it and understand how it works based on how they're written from someone else's, but I can't imagine myself writing it offline. If I can't get myself to write it offline even a little and define and explain to myself what it does, it means I do not know this language, simply put.


### Hurdles Common in the Three
- Trying to define and explain to myself on the spot what I've done as if referencing a textbook.
- Thinking of the best terms to describe, express and portray what I am trying to explain or say.
