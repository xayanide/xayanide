Haia ! If you'd like a casual user to provide manual test or feedback on your work, feel free to reach out to me via e-mail (<a href="mailto:xayanide&#64;gmail.com">xayanide@gmail.com</a>) :> and oh! It doesn't have to be formal!
Please be informed that I do manual authenticity checks on both the e-mail I receive and the sender. If either fails verification and becomes suspicious, I won't respond and will treat the e-mail as spam.
